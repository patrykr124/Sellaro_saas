<h1>AI-Powered SaaS Chatbot for Websites</h1>

This project is a SaaS platform featuring a customizable AI chatbot designed for client websites.
The chatbot can be fine-tuned and trained directly by the client, making it adaptable to specific business needs.

Originally tailored for eCommerce stores, it helps increase conversions by:

  - Recommending products based on customer needs

  - Sending direct links to relevant items

  - Comparing products in real time

However, the chatbot is not limited to eCommerce â€” it can be implemented in various industries to provide personalized, AI-driven customer support.

Key features:

  - Client-side chatbot training and tuning

  - Real-time product comparison and recommendations

  - Link sharing for quick product navigation

Flexible integration for multiple business types
